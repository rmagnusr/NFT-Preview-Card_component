### What I learned

Before I started this challenge, I was urged to analyze and plan the project before starting it. It helped me fit all the parts of the challenge together before I even started, so it enabled me to complete it faster.

### Continued development

By the first time I used the perfect pixel and I really enjoy but need get used by it. I'm also using pseudo elements for the first time and I need more practice.

### Useful resources

- Perfect Pixel (https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) - This helped me a lot, with the comparisons between my project and the design provided by frontend mentor.
